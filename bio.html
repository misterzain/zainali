<h1>Zain Ali Biography</h1>
<p>My name is Zain Ali and I am a senior studying Quantitative Economics, Finance and ELS. I chose to study quantitative economics because I have always enjoyed mathematics. Originally, I believed I wanted to go into banking, which is why I incorporated the Finance minor into my studies, but as I've matured and grown older I realize that the best environment for me to thrive professionally would be at a technology company where I could leverage the quantitative skills I've built at Tufts. As a senior, I have taken 3 different computer science courses. I decided to do this because I believe I would like to be in the FinTech realm following graduation. Although I am seeking a non-programming role, I believe it would be beneficial for me if I understood what was going on under the hood. For this reason, I chose to squeeze in comp11, comp15 and comp20 before I graduate.</p>
